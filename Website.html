            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi, I'm Martina Mifsud, a passionate animation student working toward a career in both 2D and 3D animation. This site showcases my creative journey and the projects I've created so far in both mediums. I created these artworks as part of my coursework in DGA1020, and it taught me valuable skills in modeling and rendering. I hope to keep growing my skills and eventually work in the game art industry as a modeler or environment artist. </p>

        <h3>3D Animation</h3>
        <p>This 3D fruit bowl was created using Blender, where I modelled a selection of fruits and a bowl. I used basic mesh tools along with the Sculpt tool to add organic details and refine shapes. To present the model, I created a simple turntable animation, which rotates the scene smoothly and highlights the forms from multiple angles. I also experimented with lighting to enhance depth and form, giving the scene a more polished, presentable look. This project focused on modelling fundamentals, sculpting, animation, and visual presentation.</p>

        <h3>2D Animation</h3>
        <p>This pixel-based 2D animation features an original character, an eyeball snail designed for game use. I created the artwork using pixel art techniques and animated it in Unity, focusing on smooth, readable motion for gameplay. The animation includes a full set of core movements: idle, walk, run, jump, fall, and death. This project helped me understand sprite animation, movement cycles, and how to make character motion feel responsive and expressive in a low-resolution style.</p>
