            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi, I'm Martina Mifsud, a passionate animation student working toward a career in both 2D and 3D animation. This site showcases my creative journey and the projects I've created so far in both mediums.</p>
        
            <p>I've always been fascinated by digital art and animation, especially the power of 3D modeling to bring ideas to life. This fruit bowl project is one of my first major steps toward a future career in 3D design. I created it as part of my coursework in DGA1020, and it taught me valuable skills in modeling, UV unwrapping, texturing, and rendering. I hope to keep growing my skills and eventually work in the 3D industry as a modeler or environment artist.</p>

        <h3>3D Animation</h3>
        <p>This 3D fruit bowl was created using Blender, where I modelled a selection of fruits and a bowl. I used basic mesh tools along with the Sculpt tool to add organic details and refine shapes. To present the model, I created a simple turntable animation, which rotates the scene smoothly and highlights the forms from multiple angles. I also experimented with lighting to enhance depth and form, giving the scene a more polished, presentable look. This project focused on modelling fundamentals, sculpting, animation, and visual presentation.</p>

        <h3>2D Animation</h3>
        <p>This pixel-based 2D animation features an original character, an eyeball snail designed for game use. I created the artwork using pixel art techniques and animated it in Unity, focusing on smooth, readable motion for gameplay. The animation includes a full set of core movements: idle, walk, run, jump, fall, and death. This project helped me understand sprite animation, movement cycles, and how to make character motion feel responsive and expressive in a low-resolution style.</p>
